Asynchronous Python client for the urban datasets of Hamburg (Germany).

## About

A python package with which you can retrieve data from the Urban Data Platform of Hamburg via [their API][api]. This package was initially created to only retrieve parking data from the API, but the code base is made in such a way that it is easy to extend for other datasets from the same platform.

## Installation

```bash
pip install hamburg
```

## Data

You can read the following data with this package:

- Disabled parking spaces (BehindertenstellplÃ¤tze)
- Park and ride occupancy (Park + Ride Anlagen)

## Usage

There are a number of variables you can set to retrieve the data:

- **limit** (default: 10) - How many results you want to retrieve.
- **bulk** (default: false) - If string is true, rows will be ignored and the entire result will be returned.

### Example

```python
import asyncio

from hamburg import UDPHamburg


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example on using the Parking Hamburg API client."""
    async with UDPHamburg() as client:
        disabled_parkings = await client.disabled_parkings()
        park_and_ride = await client.park_and_ride()
        print(disabled_parkings)
        print(park_and_ride)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Use cases

[NIPKaart.nl][nipkaart]

A website that provides insight into where disabled parking spaces are, based on data from users and municipalities. Operates mainly in the Netherlands, but also has plans to process data from abroad.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency
manager.

You need at least:

- Python 3.9+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages, to enter or exit the venv run the following commands:

```bash
poetry shell
exit
```

Setup the pre-commit check, you must run this inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

*Now you're all set to get started!*

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
